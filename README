Addition of https://github.com/l00g33k/WikiPland by l00g33k@gmail.com

This is a simple project adapted from perl-android-apk to provide the Perl 
runtime for WikiPland (https://github.com/l00g33k/WikiPland). WikiPland 
is a Perl based micro web server and wiki engine for the Android devices as
well as the desktop computer environment. In the expected usage on the 
Android device, the SL4A and the Perl interpreter should be installed so that 
updates can simply be fetched from github.com using git commands. However, 
for quick evaluation this APK delivers the necessary Perl interpreter as well 
as a snapshot of the WikiPland release into a single APK requiring only a 
normal APK installation.

Notes:
1. As with all other non Google Play store APK, you must allow 'Unknown 
sources' under 'Security'.
2. This APK is not full tested so some features may not function as expected.
